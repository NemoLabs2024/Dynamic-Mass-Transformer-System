# Dynamic Mass Transformer System (DMTS)

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Dynamic Mass Transformer System (DMTS)**! This project is dedicated to revolutionizing AI frameworks through ethical, adaptable intelligence, with a focus on applications in underwater exploration and scientific research.

---

## 🚀 **Project Vision**

DMTS aims to redefine the way AI models communicate and collaborate. By leveraging a modular and dynamic approach, we are creating a system that combines:
- Ethical decision-making
- Real-time adaptability
- Multi-model task handling

Our ultimate goal is to integrate DMTS into **NEMO**, the AI controlling next-generation autonomous underwater drones for ocean exploration.

## 🌊 **Why DMTS Matters**

- **Ethical AI**: Built-in ethical monitoring to ensure responsible decision-making.
- **Scalability**: A hybrid approach combining local and API-based models for efficiency and reliability.
- **Scientific Impact**: Enabling smarter, more versatile tools for oceanic research.

## 🛠️ **Project Components**

### 1. **Core AI Framework**
- A modular system for dynamic model interaction and task delegation.
- Hybrid communication using queues and task schedulers.

### 2. **Ethics Monitor**
- #Powered by a fine-tuned (Find).
- Ensures all task operations align with ethical guidelines.

### 3. **Task-Specific Models**
- **T5**: Main task handler for general operations.
- **Specialized Models**: Including coding, conversational, and future task-specific capabilities.
